                <h1>About us</h1>
            </div>
            <h3>Back in 2012, I was doing research for a presentation and stumbled upon a big problem.</h3>
            <p>India had tons of people with degrees, but companies couldn't find enough qualified workers!
                Graduates were stuck without jobs, while big companies didn't hire them.</p>
            <h3>This surprised me, especially considering how many people live in India.</h3>
            <p>After digging deeper, I discovered a huge gap in skills: only 3 out of 100 people were considered
                "ready" for good jobs. Many ended up stuck in low-paying roles like customer service, while
                countries like the UK and USA zoomed ahead.</p>
            <h3>I had experience both in business (startups) and teaching (tutoring), and I wanted to
                use both to help young people succeed.</h3>
            <p>So, after 7 years in the corporate world, I took a leap - I quit my job and started a learning center
                called Adventure Academy.</p>
            <h3>Adventure Academy isn't just about getting good grades.</h3>
            <p>We help students develop important skills like problem-solving and thinking critically.We encourage
                them to try new things, learn from their mistakes, and discover what they're good at.</p>
            <h3>We also have a digital marketing company.</h3>
            <p>This gives us real-world examples to teach our students, helping them overcome their fears
                and step into the world of possibilities.</p>

                <b>We see a talent gap in India.</b> People are bursting with ideas and starting ventures, but finding
                skilled teams is a struggle. On the other hand, <b>freshers and career seekers are eager for
                    opportunities.</b> They want to jump in and contribute, but lack the skills or the right platform to
                connect
                with the right companies.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Here's where we come in.</b> We're building a <b>bridge to close this gap.</b> We equip passionate
                individuals with the skills they need and connect them with the companies that need them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Imagine: <b>Confident graduates landing their dream jobs at exciting startups.</b> Imagine innovative
                companies finding the perfect talent to fuel their growth. That's what we see in the future, and
                that's what we're working towards every day.

            <p>Confused about your career? Everyone's screaming <b>"Digital Marketing is the future!"</b>

            <ul>
                <li>Is DM really for you? Do you enjoy writing, analysis, and creative problem-solving?</li>
                <li>Fancy certificates and year-long courses don't guarantee a job. Focus on practical skills
                    and targeted preparation.
                </li>
                <li>Job assistance, not guarantees. We'll equip you to fish, not just hand you the fish.</li>
                <li>Forget colorful classrooms and "ex-big" names. We offer real-world projects,
                    case studies, and competitor analysis.</li>
                <li>No fancy fees or BS. Straightforward learning that adds value.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is how you get cheated</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Bait and switch:</b> Promise the moon, deliver generic tools and endless theory.
                    You're left with fancy certificates, not real skills.</li>
                <li><b>Year-long slogs:</b> Drown you in long, irrelevant courses. By the time you're "qualified,"
                    the market has moved on.
                </li>
                <li><b>Job guarantee mirage:</b> They wave a magic wand, but reality? A WhatsApp group with
                    random job postings. No personalized support, just empty promises.</li>
                <li><b>All flash, no substance:</b> Fancy offices, big names, colorful brochures. But behind the
                    curtain?
                    Weak training and zero career guidance.</li>
                <li><b>Fake awards:</b> Boast about meaningless trophies, conveniently forgetting they're often paid
                    promotions.</li>

                    Live projects, case studies, and competitor analysis - get ready to roll up your sleeves!</li>
                <li><b>Targeted training:</b> No one-size-fits-all here. We assess your strengths and tailor your
                    learning to
                    your ideal career path. Internships help you discover your passion.</li>

                    honest
                    training that delivers results.</li>
                <li><b>Industry-standard prep:</b> Forget generic interview tips. We train you for real-world scenarios,
